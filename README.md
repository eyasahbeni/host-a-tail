# 🐾 Host-a-Tail

**Host-a-Tail** is more than just a rescue platform — it's a mission to build a strong, organized community that supports homeless and vulnerable animals.

In many cities, animal rescue efforts are scattered across social media pages with no central space to connect hosts, shelters, volunteers, or donors. **Host-a-Tail** brings all of that into one digital home.

## 🌟 Purpose

With this app, we aim to:

- 🏠 Find temporary or permanent homes for animals in need  
- 🤝 Connect volunteers, hosts, and shelters into one community  
- ❤️ Support through donations – not just for animals, but also for people who open their homes to protect them  
- 📢 Share updates, stories, and advice in a clean, organized platform  

> Every animal deserves safety.  
> Every act of kindness deserves support.  
> **Host-a-Tail** is here to bring them together.
